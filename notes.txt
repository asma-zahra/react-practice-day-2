TASk
    - we are  going to deploy our app for production ready.
    - we will create our own react app.
    - react is library facebook developer write for us . this library export for us lot of super power.
    - two way to access to react library
        a-use react way to using cdn
            usind cdn, we do not get production ready app. we need to minify our file..we to bundler to this app. we need to clean console  we need server to run the app. we need to optimized our app. we caching in our app. We can do all these things using Bundlers
         b- Ignite our app
            By using Bundler Parcel ignite your app for Production ready

Q- react.create ?
react.create gives object
react.create elenment take 3 parameter
  - 1- element name
  - 2- attribute (props)
  - 3- childrens[]

Q- Bundlers for Production ready app?
    we need to use BUNDLERS.
    SOME BLNDLERS NAME
    1- WEBPACK
    2- PARCEL
    3- VITE
    JOB OF BUNDLERS
    it gives us access to lot of super power. we will be using PARCEL to ignite our app
    NOTE- create-react-app uses WEBPACK bundler and babel compiler

Q-find diffrence between webpack and parcel.
    most bundler do the same job they will minify your code they will remove console and lot of optimization.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Q- How to use Parcel?
 PARCEL is package. means it is module or orgnized collection of code or some peice of code of js combined. if we want to use package in our app then we need package manager which npm.
 - instead of npm , we can use yarn
 4- dev and production build
5- parcel optimize images as well so that app runs faster
4- parcel does cheching while development
5- js optimization ,it compresses your files, minify it
6- compatible with older version of browsers
7- it add polyfills babel
8- it gievs us https 
9- pacel is dependency this dependency has also dependency..this dependy has other dependency that crete dependy tree that is called transitive dependencies 
10- Tree Shaking
localhost:1234
which is http
add hhtps
npx parel index.html --https
ab server run hoga
https://localhost:1234
9- cacheing - bcz of parcel-cachce
10- consistent hashing algorithm for all thatt bundling and cacheing
11- zero configration

Q- what is npm?
npm is not node package manager ...on thier website you check is has so many name except this on NPM website.
it is used to manage all the packages

Q- How do you use NPM in your project?
    - by initializing NPM using command , Package.JSON will created
    npm init -y
    -y is used to skip questions
    init is initialization.
    lets use npm init only and answer the question
    - package name: (react-practice) ======folder name/ directory name
    version: (1.0.0)==========by deafault
    description: This is a training of react =========anything you like
    entry point: (app.js)===========entry could be index.html as well
    test command: jest=================for testing
    git repository:=======================we will add later to track the change in our app
    keywords:===================any tag
    author: Asma Zahra============your name
    license: (ISC)====================by default

About to write to D:\React-practice\package.json:============our packgae.json is created in our app with these discription

{
  "name": "react-practice",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "This is a training of react",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "author": "Asma Zahra",
  "license": "ISC"
}

Is this OK? (yes)

Now add git repo url in Package.JSON to track chanage
 "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/asma-zahra/React-Training.git"
},
create repo on github "https://github.com/asma-zahra/React-Training.git" and push the package.json over there

Q- why do we need packages?
    bcz app can not be production ready only using create-react-app
    we need all the helper packages for that we need npm which give me access to all tha packages
    we nee to minify we need to remove console we need bundler

===========================================================================
lets just ignite our app using budler parcel
    using npm configure parcel by 
    npm install parcel

    NOTE- we don't want parcel in production we want parcel in our developer machine. for that we use -D for devolopment (dev dependencies) for that use command 
    "npm install -d parcel"

Q- What is dev dependecies
Ans- 
    dev dependecies is all the packages that our project need for develoment exp- pacel is such dependencies for our react app bcz we need bundlers
    --save-dev is same as -d
    "npm install -d parcel"
    output-
    1- we will get package.lock.json and 
    2-"devdependencies" as parcel in package.json
    3- node modules folder added

Q-  In package.JSON What caret or teld in dev dependencies?
    "devDependencies": {
        "parcel": "^2.8.2"
    } 
    ^ = carrot
    ` = tilda
    it is way to tell which version we are using
    if new version comes in our projct parcel version wil automatically upgrade using tilda or carrot

Q- what is package.lock.json?
    what version of library we are using there is no tilda or corrot
    package lock locks the pacakge. does not change.
    a- you never have to keep package-lock.JSON it in gitignore-----blunder mistake
    always keep in git
    b- it maintains version and maintains hash as well.hash insures which version running is my system is excatly that version running on production. it maintains intigrity.

Q- why node modules added?
    ans- when you install something using npm ...it add in node modules . node modules is like database for npm 

Q- how will parcel minify our code?
    see node ,module minifiers is used which is dependies of parcel that is installed in node module you check...parcel have lot of depaendency all is installed you can see in node modules. 
    exp - browserlist -which make our app compatible to older browsers

Q- should you add node module to git?
Ans - never, it is  heaivest object  we can regenrate all the same if we have package.json and packge.log.json bcz these have all dependencies in package.lock.json

Q- what amazing thing parcel do?
===================================================================================================================
Q- how to install react and react-dom in project
    npm install react
    npm install react-dom

    install another package react and reactdom not use -d bcz we dont want react in dev enviorment we want it global see it added as dependencies in package.JSON
    ans-   "dependencies": {
        "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
    }
    it is added in package.json as dependency not as dev dependency
    now we no more need cdn for react and react dom . bcz if version change cdn will not change but due to tilda or carrot react react-dom version will change in our app

===================================================
Task -now run app using npm 
Q- npx what is
    excuting code using npm that is npx
    npx parcel index.html (entry point)

    output- it started server running

    Server running at http://localhost:1234
    Installing process...

    Server running at http://localhost:1234
    âœ¨ Built in 398ms

    Parcel is giving us server

    we get error -
    Uncaught ReferenceError: React is not defined
        at app.js:1:18

    Solution-
    import react in app.js error solved
    bcz cdn use kr rahe the to error rahi thi
    ab react react dom dependecy node  module me hai....wha se import krna padega....to resolve error
===================================================================================
output error-

    Server running at http://localhost:1234
    ðŸš¨ Build failed.

    @parcel/transformer-js: Browser scripts cannot have imports or exports.

    D:\React-practice\app.js:1:1
    > 1 | import React from "react";
    >   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        2 | import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
        3 | const heading1 = React.createElement(

    D:\React-practice\index.html:11:5
        10 |     <div id="root">Not Rendered</div>
    > 11 |

    >    | ^^^^^^^^^
    > 14 | </html>
    >    | ^^^^^^^^ The environment was originally created here
        15 |

    on browser error says
    Browser scripts cannot have imports or exports.

    REASON- I have app.js we find import browser does not understand import
    Solution-
    we have to tell it is not normal js file it is module add type="module" in script tag of app.js

    output - all error gone we get heading 1 and 2
    we got warning but
    index.js:1 Warning: You are importing createRoot from "react-dom" which is not supported. You should instead import it from "react-dom/client"
    just change from this
    import ReactDOM from "react-dom" 
    to this
    import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
    warning gone

    now edit heading1 from parcel
    heading2 from parcel and it will work because parcel is doing this "HOT MODULE REPlacement"(HMD)thats why we getting changes automatically on server on browser.
=====================================================================================================

Q how does HWR work How parcel know that we change something on index.html or css
Ans- bcz Parcel is using File Watcher algorithem written in c++
reload changes is very fast in mili sec
output
heading1 from parcel
heading2 from parcel

====================================================
Q-How we get parcel cache folder
    A- parcel creates parcel cache

Q-How we get  distt folder kaise aya
    parcel creates Dist folder  it keeps the file minified for us.
    dist cretes  faster develoment versions of our app and serves it on server .
    it cretes development built for us and host it on our server
======================================================
Task-right now it is DEVELOMENT BUILD
MAKE A PRODUCTION say to parcel using BUIlD command
    - delete distt folder 
    again run command
    npx parcel build index.html
    error
    aap.js ki
    remove main point : app.js from package.json
    becz production me automatically create hogi files 

    dist\index.html              344 B    3.02s
    dist\index.d7d1395c.js    140.3 KB    2.05s

    parcel cretes this files dist\index.html dist\index.d7d1395c.js 
    now you can see all that code that we wriitten in app.js in it mapped in dist folder index inde444.js at the last portion
    ------parcel 1- minified it 2- bundled everything
    you will not find console log....bcz parcle... has 3- cleaned our code ....4- just in mili sec

Q- why shuld put in .parcel-caches and dist folder in gitignore
Ans-
    yes .parcel-cache and dist is auto generated using command
    npx parcel build index.html
    we con generate node modules ny using 
    npm install

Q- Tree Shaking parcel does it
Ans - 
    removing unwanted code. how parcel do it?
    library has so many func, we have usd just few,
    parcel is very smart it remove rest func which is not used in the code

===============================================
Q- diff between react and reactdom
react- core package
reactdom- package for manipulating DOM

Q- why react is popular and faster
    A- bcz of bundlers like parcel and parcel has lot of dependencies
==============================================
Q- BrowserList?
parcel gives broswelist which makes our app compatible to older browsers
how to use browserlist
goto browserlist-npm google
  "browserslist": [
    "Last two version"
  ]
add this in package.json  "Last two version" - it will take care  of version last 2 version of all browser availbe
======================================================

Q- use npm what to do initiaze it ?
A-   using npm init
    it give package.json
Q- parcel for dev dependency= npm i -d parcel
    it create packege-lock-json

Q-excute the parcel
    npx parcel index.html
    it enables cahing, budling, craete server, hot loading replacemnt  (HMR)

Q- react install
    NPm i react 
    npm i react-dom
    error
    import ke baad
    type = module 

=================================================

create-react-app uses Babel and webpack
